# Women Shop

This app simulates a normal and easy store behavior.
With category filter, we can list the elements by category.
When we select a item, the "openContainer" is fired. The we see the details screen.
In the details screen, we see the carousel gallery and the description.
- In the gallery is a collection of images and videos. 
- In the description we can see the name, price, a short description, rating and we can choose the color and the size.
